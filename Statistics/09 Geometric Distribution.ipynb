    "A negative binomial experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:\n",
    "- The experiment consists of $n$ repeated trials.\n",
    "- The trials are independent.\n",
    "- The outcome of each trial is either success ($s$) or failure ($f$).\n",
    "- $P(s)$ is the same for every trial.\n",
    "The experiment continues until $x$ successes are observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $X$ is the number of experiments until the $x^{th}$ success occurs, then $X$ is a discrete random variable called a negative binomial. \n",
